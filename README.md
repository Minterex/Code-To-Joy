# Code-To-Joy

As someone who plans to start a coding journey in Python to create apps and projects, I would like a place to store all my projects in. Apps such as file explorer will do just
fine, but I would like something flashier and more professional looking. Therefore, I created my first ever official app to be a sort of "library" to contain all the beginner projects I have done so far. The projects
will be accessed through buttons in a software created entirely from Python and its Tkinter library. This is "Code To Joy".

# Disclaimer
Some of the resources and codes inside my project relies on actions that involve taking things from my local file explorer or files. This includes resources such as pictures and buttons that opens separate apps. Due to this, others cannot use the exact code I used to open the pictures in my apps as they do not have it in their files, and they do not have the specific path. Same applies to opening the apps through my Code To Joy library. In order for Code To Joy to work, all the projects must be placed in the same exact path as mine.
