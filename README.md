# Code-To-Joy

As someone who plans to start a coding journey in Python to create apps and projects, I would like a place to store all my projects in. Apps such as file explorer will do just
fine, but I would like something flashier and more professional looking. Therefore, I created my first ever official app to be a sort of "library" to contain all the projects I have done so far. The projects
will be accessed through buttons in a software created entirely from Python and its Tkinter library. This is "Code To Joy".
